# video-testimonial-backend

A Django backend for a system to collect video and audio testimonials. Visit the repo for the React frontend [here](https://github.com/AbigailMathews/video-testimonial).

This project was built to support the nonprofit ListenFirst and their America Talks project. America Talks pairs participants across geographic and political divides and allows them to engage in conversations about the topics that are important to them.

The video testimonial tool allows ListenFirst to collect impressions and feedback from participants immediately after completing a conversation.

This app has a customized Django admin panel that allows ListenFirst staff to review, rate, and download submitted audio and video testimonials, so that they can be used for promoting America Talks to prospective participants and also improving their programs.
